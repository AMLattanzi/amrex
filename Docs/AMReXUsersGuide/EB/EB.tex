For computations with complex geometries, $\tt{AMReX}$ provides data
structures and iterators for performing Cartesian grid, embedded
boundary (EB) calculations.   Examples include elliptic solvers and a
compressible Navier Stokes simulation.  
The overall goals of $\tt{AMReX}$'s EB tools are to allow users 
to write simulations involving complex geomtery  without having to
rewrite the common motifs that appear in these calculations.  
We give an overview of $\tt{AMReX}$'s EB classes and how to use them.

\section{Overview of Embedded Boundary Description}
\label{sec:EB:EBOverview}

Cartesian grids with embedded boundaries are 
useful to describe
volume-of-fluid representations of irregular boundaries.
In this description,
geometry is represented by volumes ($\Lambda h^d$) and apertures 
($\vec{A}^\alpha h^{d-1}$).   See figure \ref{fig::volume}
for an illustration.  In the figure, the grey area represents 
the region excluded from the solution domain and the arrows represent
fluxes.  A conservative, ``finite volume'' discretization
of a flux divergence $\nabla \cdot \vec{F}$ is of the form:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} \approx \frac{1}{\Lambda h} \sum \vec{F}^\alpha \cdot
\vec{A}^\alpha
\end{equation}
This is useful for many important partial differential equations.
Consider  Poisson's equation with Neumann boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \Delta \phi = \rho \hbox{ on $\Omega$ }.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = 0 \hbox{ on $\partial \Omega$}
\end{equation}
The volume-of fluid description reduces the problem to finding
sufficiently accurate gradients at the apertures.   
The only geometric information required for second order embedded
boundary algorithms are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Volume fractions
\item
Area fractions
\item 
Centers of volume, area.
\end{itemize}
The problem with this description of the geometry 
is it can create  multiply-valued cells and
non-rectangular connectivity.
Refer to figure \ref{fig::graph}.  
The interior of the cartoon airfoil represents the area
excluded from the domain and the lines connecting the cell centers
represent the connectivity of the discrete domain
This very simple geometry produces a graph
which is more complex than a rectangular lattice simply because
the grid which surrounds it cannot resolve the geometry.
The lack of resolution is fundamental to many geometries 
of interest (trailing edges of airfoils, infinitely thin shells).
Algorithms which require grid coarsening (multigrid, for example)
also produce grids where such complex connectivity occurs.
The connectivity can become arbitrarily complex (see figure 
\ref{fig::multidivide}) in general, so the software infrastructure
must support abstractions which can express this complexity.

Our solution to this abstraction problem is to
define the embedded boundary grid as a graph.
The irregular part of the index space can be represented by a graph 
$G = \{N,E\}$, where $N$ is the set of all nodes in the graph, and 
$E$ the set of all edges of the graph connecting various pairs of 
nodes. Geometrically,
the nodes correspond to irregular control volumes (cell fragments) 
cut out by the intersection of the body with the rectangular mesh, and 
the edges correspond to the parts of cell faces that abut a pair of irregular 
cell fragments. The remaining parts of space are indexed using elements
of $Z^d$, or are covered by the body, and not indexed into at all. However,
it is possible to think of the entire index space (both the regular and
irregular parts) as a graph: in the regular part of the index space,
the nodes are just elements of $Z^d$, and the 
edges are the cell faces that
separate pair of successive cells along the coordinate directions.

\section{Initializing \ebis}
\label{sec:EB:ebinit}

This geometric information, along with its associated connectivity
graph is stored in a distributed database class \ebis which must be
initialized at the start of the calculation.    The procedure for this
goes as follows.   To initialize this database, one follows these steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define an implicit function which describes the surface 
      and use it define a \geom object (see \S
      \ref{sec:EB:geometryshop}).
\item Call $\tt{EBIndexSpace::define}$ with the \geom object.   This
  will fill the database of graph and moment data.   It is important
  to define this using the finest resolution of domain that will be
  used in the calculation.   Coarser information is generated
  automatically by \ebis by graph coarsening.
\end{itemize}
As an illustration, here is how one would define the \ebis where the
geometry is described as the complement of a sphere of radius 0.1
centered inside a unit cube where the maxium resolution is $1024^3$.
The classes involved are described in \S \ref{sec:EB:geometryshop}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]

  int nx = 1024;
  Box domain(IntVect::Zero, (nx-1)*IntVect::Unit);
  Real dx = 1.0/nx;
  Real radius = 0.1;
  Real center = 0.5*RealVect::Unit;
  bool insideRegular = false;
  //this is the implicit function
  SphereIF sphere(radius, center, insideRegular);

  //this is worker object that creates geometric information given an IF
  GeometryShop workshop(sideImpMultisphere)

  //this is the global, distributed database being initialized
  EBIndexSpace*  ebis = AMReX_EBIS::instance()
  ebis->define(domain, RealVect::Zero, dx, workshop);

\end{lstlisting}

%%After this initialization is complete, any part of the calculation can
%%access the data via $\tt{EBIndexSpace::fillEBISLayout}$.

\subsection{GeometryShop and Implicit Functions}
\label{sec:EB:geometryshop}

One of the greatest advantages of EB technology is that grid
generation is robust and fast and can be done to any accuracy
The foundation class that AMReX uses for
geometry generation is called \geom.  Given an implicit
function $I$  \geom interprets the surface upon which $I(\xbold) = 0$
as the surface with which to cut the grid cells.   \geom interprets
the positive regions of the implicit function ($\xbold: I(\xbold) > 0$)
as covered by the geometry  negative regions ($\xbold: I(\xbold) < 0$) 
as part of  the solution domain.  For example, if one defines her
implicit function $S$ as
$$
S(\xbold) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - R^2,
$$
the solution domain would be the interior of a sphere of radius $R$.
Reverse the sign of $S$ and the solution domain would be the exterior
of the sphere.   

To define a geometry shop, one
needs to send it a \baseif, which describes an implict function. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
    GeometryShop(const BaseIF& a_localGeom)
\end{lstlisting}

The implicit function's interface needs to be able to do two things,
create a copy of itself and return the value of the function at any
point in space.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
    /// Return the value of the function at a_point.  
    virtual Real value(const RealVect& a_point) const = 0;

    ///   Return a newly allocated derived class.  
    virtual BaseIF* newImplicitFunction() const = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

To continue with the example above, if one wants to define a geometry
as a domain with  a sphere cut out of it, one uses the \sphereif
class, the functions of which are shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
    SphereIF::
    SphereIF(const Real&     a_radius,
             const RealVect& a_center,
             const bool&     a_inside)
    {
     m_radius  = a_radius;
     m_radius2 = m_radius*m_radius;
     m_inside  = a_inside;
     m_center  = a_center;
    }

  Real
  SphereIF::
  value(const RealVect& a_point) const
  {
    RealVect dist = a_point - m_center;
    Real distance2 = dist.radSquared();
    Real retval = distance2 - m_radius2;
    // Change the sign to change inside to outside
    if (!m_inside)
      {
        retval = -retval;
      }

    return retval;
  }
  BaseIF* 
  SphereIF::
  newImplicitFunction() const
  {
    SphereIF* spherePtr = new SphereIF(m_radius,
                                       m_center,
                                       m_inside);

    return static_cast<BaseIF*>(spherePtr);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

One can get by with very simple implicit functions such as sphere and
plane because one can create more complicated geometries by
composition of simple implicit functions.    AMReX contains the
following classes which are used compose implicit functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tt{TransformIF}$    allows for translations and rotations of an implicit function.
\item $\tt{UnionIF}$        produces the union of two implicit functions.  
\item $\tt{IntersectionIF}$ produces the intersection of two implicit functions.
\item $\tt{LatheIF}$        creates a 3D implicit function as the surface of
  revolution of a 2D implicit function.
\end{itemize}
Here is an example that uses many of these tools.  This example
creates a geometry with multiple spheres cut out.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]

//say you have a bunch of radii and centers of spheres
/* fill these in however you like */
vector<Real>     radius(numSpheres);
vector<RealVect> center(numSpheres);
...
//create an implicit function for each sphere
vector<BaseIF*>  spheres(numSpheres);

for(int isphere = 0; isphere < numSpheres; isphere++)
{
  //create each sphere at the origin and translate
  SphereIF sphereAtZero(radius[isphere], RealVect::Zero, false);
  TransformIF* movedSphere = new TransformIF(sphereAtZero);
  movedSphere->translate(center[isphere]);
  spheres[isphere] = static_cast<BaseIF*>(movedSphere);
}
//create an implicit function that is the intersection of all the spheres
IntersectionIF impMultisphere(spheres);
//we want the fluid to be the complement (the space outside the sphere
ComplementIF sideImpMultisphere(impMultisphere, false);
//create the geometryshop
GeometryShop workshop(sideImpMultisphere)
\end{lstlisting}


\section{$\tt{EBFarrayBox}$}

The fundamental data structure for embedded boundary calculations is 
$\tt{EBFArrayBox}$, a class is an a $\tt{FArrayBox}$ with two extra
data members.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tt{EBFArrayBox::getEBISBox}$ returns an $\tt{EBISBox}$, a data
  structure that contains the graph and geometric information for a
  particular box.
\item $\tt{EBFArrayBox::getEBCellFlagFab}$  is a
  $\tt{BaseFab<EBCellFlag>}$, where $\tt{EBCellFlag}$ is a class which
  is a very compact class that specify connectivity information
  (number of volumes in the cell, which cells are connected to my
  cell...) for a particular cell.
\end{itemize}
If one compiles with $\tt{AMREX\_USE\_EB = TRUE}$, the state data that
${\tt Amr}$ generates is already of type $\tt{EBFArrayBox}$ under the
hood and one can access the functions via cast.   The
$\tt{EBCellFlagFab}$ can be used to choose whether it is necessary to call an
EB-specfic routine. $\tt{EBCellFlagFab}$  can be sent also be sent to Fortran to 
enable EB-specific logic.   

\subsection{Example}
The example below is a simplified version
of one of the routines in $\tt{Tutorial/EB/CNS}$.   Note  that  it
carefully calls the more complicated EB fortran routine if the
particular tile has cut cells.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
void
CNS::compute_dSdt (const MultiFab& S, MultiFab& dSdt, Real dt,
                   EBFluxRegister* fr_as_crse, EBFluxRegister* fr_as_fine)
{
    BL_PROFILE("CNS::compute_dSdt()");

    const Real* dx = geom.CellSize();
    const int ncomp = dSdt.nComp();

#ifdef _OPENMP
#pragma omp parallel
#endif
     {
        //fluxes for the advance
        std::array<FArrayBox,AMREX_SPACEDIM> flux;

        for (MFIter mfi(S, MFItInfo().EnableTiling(hydro_tile_size).SetDynamic(true));
                        mfi.isValid(); ++mfi)
        {
            //this tile is the subset of the box over which we are computing
            const Box& bx = mfi.tilebox();

            //because we have compiled with AMREX_USE=EB_TRUE, the
            //MultiFab holds EBFArrayBox(es) so we can do this cast
            const EBFArrayBox& sfab = dynamic_cast<EBFArrayBox
            const&>(S[mfi]);
            
            //here we are getting the collection of flags so we know
            //kind of grid this is and if it is an EB grid, we have
            //the connectivity info
            const EBCellFlafgFab & flag = sfab.getEBCellFlagFab();

            if (flag.getType(bx) == FabType::covered) 
            {
              //this tile is covered so there are no meaningful data here
                dSdt[mfi].setVal(0.0, bx, 0, ncomp);
            } 
            else 
            {
              //create the flux holders for this tile
              for (int idim=0; idim < AMREX_SPACEDIM; ++idim) 
              {
                flux[idim].resize(amrex::surroundingNodes(bx,idim),ncomp);
              }

              if (flag.getType(amrex::grow(bx,1)) == FabType::regular)
              {
                //this tile has no cut cells so we can just proceed
                //with a (cheaper) non-eb call

                cns_compute_dudt(BL_TO_FORTRAN_BOX(bx),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(dSdt[mfi]),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(S[mfi]),

              else
              {
                //this tile has cut cells so we have to send into Fortran
                //EBCellFlagFAB as well as lots of geometric
                //information

                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(areafrac[0][mfi]),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(areafrac[1][mfi]),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(areafrac[2][mfi]),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(facecent[0][mfi]),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(facecent[1][mfi]),
                BL_TO_FORTRAN_ANYD(facecent[2][mfi]),
                dx, &dt);
              }
            }
          }
        }

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Fortran bits}

Now the Fortran that underlies these two cases is quite different.
For the non-EB case,    the one loop in the function is given by the
familiar-looking example below:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
    do n = 1, ncomp
       do       k = lo(3),hi(3)
          do    j = lo(2),hi(2)
             do i = lo(1),hi(1)
                ut(i,j,k,n) = (fx(i,j,k,n)-fx(i+1,j,k,n)) * dxinv(1) &
                     +        (fy(i,j,k,n)-fy(i,j+1,k,n)) * dxinv(2) &
                     +        (fz(i,j,k,n)-fz(i,j,k+1,n)) * dxinv(3)
             end do
          end do
       end do
    end do
\end{lstlisting}

For the embedded boundary version, the code must is much more
complicated. To avoid instabilities associated with arbitrarily small
cells, the divergence is computed in stages.  For this discussion
$\kappa$ is the volume fraction of a cell.  The stages of the
divergence are given by
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the $\kappa$-weighted divergence.
\item Compute a nonconservative approximation to the divergence that
  is a local average of the previous object.
\item Update the state with a hybrid divergence.
\item Redistribute  mass to preserve conservation.
\end{itemize}
It is beyond the scope of this document to explain all that.  We
include it only to provide the context that EB stencils can be much
more complex that non-EB ones.   Suffice
it to say that the first step of that process is most closely related
to the code above.    The loop that computes the $\kappa$-weighted
divergence is given below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
    do n = 1, ncomp

       !
       ! First, we compute conservative divergence on (lo-2,hi+2)
       !
       iwall = 0
       do       k = lo(3)-2, hi(3)+2
          do    j = lo(2)-2, hi(2)+2
             do i = lo(1)-2, hi(1)+2
                divc(i,j,k) = (fluxx(i,j,k,n)-fluxx(i+1,j,k,n))*dxinv(1) &
                     +        (fluxy(i,j,k,n)-fluxy(i,j+1,k,n))*dxinv(2) &
                     +        (fluxz(i,j,k,n)-fluxz(i,j,k+1,n))*dxinv(3)
             end do

             do i = lo(1)-2, hi(1)+2
                if (is_covered_cell(cellflag(i,j,k))) then
                   divc(i,j,k) = 0.d0
                else if (is_single_valued_cell(cellflag(i,j,k))) then

                   call get_neighbor_cells(cellflag(i,j,k),nbr)
