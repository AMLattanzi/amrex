AMReX Introduction
==================

AMReX is a publicly available software framework designed for
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) applications.

Key features of AMReX include:

-  C++ and Fortran interfaces

-  1-, 2- and 3-D support

-  Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and
   nodal data

-  Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on
   hierarchical adaptive grid structure

-  Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs

-  Support for particles

-  Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI

-  Parallel I/O

-  Plotfile format supported by AmrVis, VisIt, ParaView, and yt.

AMReX is developed at LBNL, NREL, and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR Co-Design 
Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project. AMReX is under continual development-- new 
changes are first pushed to the development branch and then merged into master at the 
beginning of each month.  If you want to contribute to AMReX, clone the AMReX git 
repo, make your changes on "development" and then issue a pull-request to the AMReX 
"development" branch.  To obtain help, simply post an issue in the AMReX GitHub webpage
at https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex

Besides this documentation, there is documentation generated by Doxygen at 
https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/doxygen. Documentation on migration from 
BoxLib is available at Docs/Migration.
