regtest.py is the main regression testing script for BoxLib-based
applications.  Typing './regtest.py -h' will give a verbose
description of usage and setup.

Quickstart:

1. Each regression test suite is defined in a separate configuration
file.  BoxLib is distributed with a number of such files in
Tools/RegressionTesting

2. With LMC-tests.ini as an example

 a. LMC depends on the CCSE repositories: BoxLib, IAMR, Combustion

 b. In the config blocks of the .ini file, the locations of clones
    of these files to use for testing are set as "dir"

    For each [BoxLib], [source] and [extra-IAMR], the tester pulls
    the desired branch/SHA prior to building/running tests. Best to
    have these as "extra" clones used solely for this purpose so 
    that the tester can work on its own without confusing you.

    Thus...edit the paths in the config file to point to local clones
    of each of these repos.

 c. Parameters that define each regression test appear in labeled
    blocks.  I suspect that the number of options allowed for is going
    to grow indefinitely; just look at examples in all the other .ini
    files for what is available.

 d. Each labeled test will be built, run and compared to "benchmark"
    results.  The results of these tasks will be formatted into a
    web page in a folder defined as "webTopDir" in the .ini file.
    Make sure that variable points to something you like and can access.

 e. You need benchmarks to exist before the tests can work.  Generate
    them manually with 

    ./regtest.py --make_benchmarks "<some useful comment>" LMC-tests.ini

 f. Afterward, tests are run by typing

    ./regtest.py LMC-tests.ini
