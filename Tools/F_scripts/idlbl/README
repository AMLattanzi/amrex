Some IDL routines to visualize Maestro data -- these are based on my
original FLASH IDL routines.

To use these, set the environment variable IDLBL_DIR to the path
containing these files.

You will also need to modify the IDL search path, by setting IDL_PATH
to

${IDLBL_DIR}:${IDL_DIR}/lib:${IDL_DIR}/lib/utilities

where IDL_DIR is the path to your IDL installation


For Linux machines, it is usually best to start idl as

idl start_linux.pro



Basic visualization is done by first writting out a raw file
containing a single variable using fIDLdump in
fParallel/data_processing.  For example:

./fIDLdump.Linux.Intel.debug.exe -cname "tfromrho" plt0000


Then in IDL, you can view this with:

plotraw, 'plt0050.tfromH.raw'
