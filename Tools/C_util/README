This directory contains code, useful for debugging, but which didn't
seem to belong anywhere else.

TV_TempWrite.H            Allows access to writeMF and readMF functions for
                            writing/reading MultiFab's into a file format
                            readible by the little functions in the ViewMF
                            subdirectory here

preload.cpp               Contains BSP initialization stuff needed for any
                            code linking to BSP.  It is used by all the apps
                            and test codes in the paralle environment

WritePlotFile.[H,cpp]     Define a function called writePlotFile which takes
                            a MultiFab and writes it into a HyperCLawV1.1 
                            pltfile format readible by pAmrvis

ViewMF                    Code for building a viewer for 2D and 3D which 
                            simply calls ArrayView after reading MultiFabs
                            written by writeMF defined in TV_TempWrite.H
                            The trivial code builds a simple viewer or a
                            viewer to the difference between two written
                            MultiFabs (useful for comparing output of two
                            separate codes).
