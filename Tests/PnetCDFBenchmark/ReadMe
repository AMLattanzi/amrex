This benchmark is translated from the HDF5 benchmark. It store the plot file in NetCDF format using the PnetCDF library.

The usage and options is exactly the same as the HDF5 benchmark. Run the benchmark program with a input file containing the configuration. inputs is an example input file.

To build the benchmark:
    First, edit the GNUmakefile:
        set variable "PNETCDF_HOME" to the install directory of PnetCDF library
    Then, simply run make

To run the benchmark:
    ./<benchmark> inputs

Note:
    open MP in GNUmakefile should remain disabled since PnetCDF does not officialy support open MP.

Example result:
