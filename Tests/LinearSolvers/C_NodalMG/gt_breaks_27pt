THIS GRID CONFIGURATION BREAKS THE CURRENT (06/06/06) PARALLEL/HGPROJ 27-PT (DENSE)
SOLVER - THE SOLVER WILL NOT CONVERGE.

ON THE WAY BACK UP THE FIRST V-CYCLE THE VALUE OF THE RESIDUAL AT THE POINT (16,16,15) IS
DIFFERENT IN GRID 0 THAN AT THAT SAME POINT IN GRIDS 2 and 3 
(THE VALUES IN GRIDS 2 and 3 ARE THE SAME).

THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTS BECAUSE THE SOLUTION HAS VALUE 0. AT (17,15,16) in GRID 0 
BUT HAS THE VALUE 0.0037324377 IN GRIDS 2 and 3.

NOTE THAT THIS GRID CONFIGURATION IS DERIVED FROM GTBIG3 WHICH ALSO FAILS FOR
THIS REASON.
