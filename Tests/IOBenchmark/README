this is a boxlib i/o test (just o, really),
it writes a multifab.  the usage is:

Usage:
iotest3d.Linux.g++.gfortran.MPI.ex
   [nfiles = nfiles]
   [maxgrid = maxgrid]
   [ncomps = ncomps]
   [nboxes = nboxes]
   [nsleep = nsleep]
   [ntimes = ntimes]


the range [1,nprocs] is enforced for nfiles.
ncomps is the number of FAB components.
ntimes is the number of times to run the test.

example run:

mpiexec -n 4 iotest3d.Linux.g++.gfortran.MPI.ex nfiles=4 maxgrid=64 ncomps=16 nboxes=32 ntimes=4
