This code is a very simple code designed to profile communication patterns 
associated with the MultiFabFillBoundary operation, which exchanges ghost cells
between the FABs in a single multifab.

All this code does, for a certain set of parameters, is to 
 * create a MultiFab which has "nGhost" ghost cells and "nComp" components
 * fill the data with the value 1.0 everywhere
 * exchange "nGhost" ghost cells of "nComp" components of the data in the FABs in this MultiFab
 * exchange either the faces only ("cross" = true) or all 26 nearest neighbor exchanges ("cross" = false")

We have a separate call for each combination:
 
 * nComp = 1, 4, 20
 * nGhost = 1, 2, 3, 4
 * cross = true or false
