There are six Fortran90 HeatEquation examples in this section.  All six examples
can be running using MPI and/or OpenMP.  Here is a brief overview of the six:

HeatEquation_EX1_F:  This is the simplest of the examples -- it solves the heat equation
explicitly on a single level in a domain with periodic boundary conditions

HeatEquation_EX2_F:  This example extends HeatEquation_EX1_F by allowing for Dirichlet 
or Neumann boundary conditions in addition to periodic.   This example introduces the
use of the "bc_tower" which holds the boundary conditions for the domain.

HeatEquation_EX3_F:   This example extends HeatEquation_EX2_F by allowing fixed multiple
levels of refinement.   All levels are advanced with the same time step.

HeatEquation_EX4_F:    This example extends HeatEquation_EX3_F by allowing time adaptation
of the refined levels, by allowing cells to be tagged and new grids to be formed every 
regrid_int steps.

HeatEquation_EX5_F:  This is an extension of HeatEquation_EX4_F which allows implicit as
well as explicit solution of the heat equation.   This introduces the use of the multilevel
linear solvers in the BoxLib/LinearSolvers/F_MG directory.

HeatEquation_EX6_F:  This is an extension of HeatEquation_EX4_F, but differs in that it
allows subcycling in time rather than advancing all levels with the same timestep.  This 
example introduces the use of boundary registers to store fluxes for refluxing.
