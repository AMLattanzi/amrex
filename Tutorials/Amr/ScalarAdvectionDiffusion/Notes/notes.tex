To change between the different ways of advancing the solution, change
the code in advance() between the godunov, molrk2 and molrk3 options.

MOLRK2 follows the same RK2 algorithm as CNS.
MOLRK3 follows the algorithm described in gottlieb, et al.
$$
u^(1) = u^n +  + \dt L(u^n)  \\
u^(2) = (3/4) u^n + (1/4) u^(1)  + (1/4) L(u^(1))
u^{n+1} = (1/3) u^n + (2/3) u^(2)  + (2/3) L(u(2))
$$
