\section{Basic advance}
To change between the different ways of advancing the solution, change
the code in advance() between the godunov, molrk2 and molrk3 options.

MOLRK2 follows the same RK2 algorithm as CNS.
MOLRK3 follows the algorithm described in gottlieb, et al.
$$
u^(1) = u^n +  + \dt L(u^n)  \\
u^(2) = (3/4) u^n + (1/4) u^(1)  + (1/4) L(u^(1))
u^{n+1} = (1/3) u^n + (2/3) u^(2)  + (2/3) L(u(2))
$$

\subsection{Flux register factors}

Since 
$$
u^{n+1} = (1/3) u^n + (2/3) u^(2)  + (2/3) \dt L(u(2))
$$

This means 
$$
u^{n+1} = (1/3) u^n + (2/3)((3/4)(u^n) + (1/4)(u^1) + (1/4)\dt L(u^1))  + (2/3)( \dt L(u(2)))
$$

which, in turn, means
$$
u^{n+1} = (1/3) u^n + (2/3)((3/4)(u^n) + (1/4)(u^n + \dt L(u^n)) + (1/4)\dt L(u^1))  + (2/3)( \dt L(u^2))
$$

So the coefficient of $L(u^n) = (2/3)(1/4)\dt$, so I should set the
flux register coefficient for the first evaluation $c_n = (1/6)\dt$.
The coeffcient of $L(u^1) = (2/3)(1/4)\dt = 1/6 \dt$
The coeffcient of $L(u^2) = (2/3) \dt$.   So for the three evaluations
of the operator, the time step  that fluxes should see are $\dt/6,
dt/6, 2\dt/3$, respectively.


\section{Stuff I am not sure about}

\begin{itemize}
  \item I am not sure where to set the time levels  in the fill patch thing.
