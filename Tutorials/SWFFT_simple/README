This Tutorial demonstrates how to call the SWFFT wrapper to the FFTW3 solver.

In this test case we call the forward transform on an array of data.

To build the code, type 'make' in this directory.

To run the code, type 'main3d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs' in this directory

To visualize the output, use amrvis3d (source available at https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/Amrvis):

amrvis3d plt_fft

The DFT of the data as well as the original array can be viewed as separate 
variables in the plotfile "plt_fft"
