This compact app explicitly advances the heat equation in time
using forward Euler.  The equation being solved is U_t = coef * Lap(U)
for a single variable U.   Lap(U) is computed by first defining fluxes
at each level representing grad(U) on normal faces, then averaging the fluxes
down on faces to be consistent between levels.   Then the solution is updated
at each level as U^new = U^old + dt * coef * div(grad(U)). The fine solution
is then averaged onto the coarser grids beneath.

It is a BoxLib based code designed to run in parallel using a hybrid
model with MPI to distribute grid patches and OpenMP directives to thread
the loops over data in the grid patches.

The directory includes a GNUmakefile and a sample inputs file.  Plotfiles are generated
that can be viewed with amrvis2d/amrvis3d (CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool) or with Visit.

To build the code you need to specify the location where you have placed BoxLib in the GNUmakefile.
